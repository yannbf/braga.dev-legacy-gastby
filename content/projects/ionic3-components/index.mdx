This project was made in order to help people learn and speed up their development process. It is actually what made me start doing open source. 
In 2016 I was learning Ionic, back when it was in its alpha 2 version, and noticed there was an official slack channel. 
After joining, I quickly went from the guy who was always asking questions to the guy who was answering the questions, and as lots of people were seeking help for similar things, 
I created a repository of which I would add those examples and help others. 

You will find many many different components, pages, pipes, services, of which can be very useful to you. There are over 65 pages containing all kinds of layouts such as Profile, Login, Lists, Slides, Modals, Walkthroughs, Custom side-menus, Product listings, and others. Note though that these were all experimental.
The content here is a mix of tutorials found online, a few adapted codepen projects, a few dribbble inspired layouts, and also other examples and components made by the amazing contributors of this project!
